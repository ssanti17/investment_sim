# Investment Simulator


---

### Description

This is a R Shiny App I created for Stat 133: Concepts in Computing with Data. The app is an investment simulator that simulates investing in a Total Stock Market index fund. Users are able to adjust simulations based on various factors and view the changing time-series visualization. 


### Tools Used

This program was coded in R and the app was deployed using R shiny. Packages dplyr and ggplot2 were also used for data manipulation/visualization.
